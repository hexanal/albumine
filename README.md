# HX

Just a barebone Wordpress theme that helps with the customizing of the Adminstration panel.

This is to be used for the backend only; the Wordpress content generated will be consumed from a separate codebase, via the WP REST API.

This theme expects the Advanced Custom Field plugin to be installed on the Wordpress instance.

## Roadmap

* Create interface to expand the API
* Use this expansion of the API to allow registering/logging in via the API
* Allow fetching of custom post metadata via the API
