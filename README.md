# Albumine

A quick project to see if I can build something that hosts photo albums I want to make "semi-public".

## why?

- don't want to use Google's shit, or Apple's, or Amazon's shit: I want my own shit
- I want to share stuff and figure out who sees what, when: I'M THE ONE WHO TRACKS
- I get to design something, I get to test Wordpress' Gutenberg thing, finally... I'm way behind
